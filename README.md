Glass-Head
==========

Arduino code for my Glass Head spectrum analyzer project

Glass_Head.ino = the final code
Glass_Head_Test.ino = some interim test code for getting the hardware working
Glass_Head_LED_map.ino = test code to assist with mapping the actual position of the LEDs
Glass_Head_TEST_map.ino = test code to confirm that the position maps are okay
